We spent an inspiring Friday today, October 31, 2025, at Dipoli in Espoo, where the most anticipated event of the year in the field, the Early Childhood Education Fair 2025, was held.

There was a lively buzz at the VakaCloud stand from morning until afternoon. It was great to meet so many early childhood education professionals face-to-face!

### Simplicity Charmed the Fair Visitors

We got to present VakaCloud to interested daycare directors and educators. In particular, the new mobile interface released in September received a huge amount of praise for its clarity.

*"Finally, a system that looks like it was made for us,"* was one of the most memorable comments we received at our stand.

**Key Takeaways from the Fair:**
1.  **Interest in Security:** Data security and data location in Finland have become important criteria when choosing a system.
2.  **Saving Time:** Managers are feverishly looking for ways to reduce administrative burden.
3.  **Ease of Communication:** Communication between home and daycare is desired in one secure place, away from WhatsApp and emails.

Thank you to everyone who visited our stand and to the organizers for the wonderful setting at Dipoli! If you didn't make it to the fair, you can book a remote demo with us at any time.
