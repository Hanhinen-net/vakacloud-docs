### New Features

**1. Detailed Information**
We have added dedicated, protected fields for critical information:
* This information appears highlighted to the persons in charge of the group.

**2. Security Updates**
* **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Support for Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator apps has now been activated for all users.
* **Audit Logging:** Even more precise logging of data viewing and editing improves data protection.

The update has been installed automatically and requires no action.
