### What has been fixed?

We have reacted quickly to new security findings and made the following corrections:

* **Improved protection against Denial of Service attacks:** We have strengthened the system's ability to handle unusual traffic and prevent service overload. This guarantees reliable service operation in all situations. (Related to vulnerabilities CVE-2025-55184 and CVE-2025-67779).
* **Strengthened system integrity:** We have tightened the security of internal components and software code to prevent the exposure of sensitive technical data to outsiders. (Related to vulnerability CVE-2025-55183).

Our system monitoring is in an enhanced state following the update.
