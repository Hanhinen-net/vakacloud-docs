Our latest VakaCloud update brings two major improvements: support for multilingual usage and a highly requested bulk import tool that significantly streamlines data management.
At the same time, we have improved the mobile user experience and file management to make your daily operations even smoother.

## VakaCloud is Now Multilingual

The service now fully supports both **Finnish** and **English**. This greatly facilitates daily operations and communication in multicultural daycare centers.

* **Language Selection:** You can switch the application language between Finnish and English instantly from the top bar.
* **Coverage:** Translations cover the entire application: calendars, messages, child profiles, and admin panels.

## Bulk Import Simplifies Data Entry

We have introduced a new tool for administrators that makes adding large numbers of users effortless. You no longer need to enter every piece of information manually one by one.

* **CSV Import:** You can import children, guardians, and staff into the system by uploading a ready-made Excel or CSV file.
* **Templates:** Downloadable templates are available directly in the service to guide you in formatting the data correctly.

## Smoother User Experience & Files

We have refined the user interface based on your feedback:

* **File Management:** The file section has been redesigned for clarity and security. Managing and deleting files is now more intuitive.

## Technical Improvements

Under the hood, we have made critical changes to service stability:

* **Connection Reliability:** Real-time features, such as messaging, are now more stable thanks to improved backend technology.
* **Account Management:** We have extended the time window for account updates, so registration and verification do not expire as quickly.
* **Group Management:** Fixed an issue related to removing members from groups.
