We are proud to present VakaCloud – a completely new management system for early childhood education developed in Finland. Our goal is simple: to free up professionals' time from administration back to the children.

VakaCloud was born out of the need to create a system that is genuinely user-friendly and secure. We have developed the service in close cooperation with early childhood education professionals.
