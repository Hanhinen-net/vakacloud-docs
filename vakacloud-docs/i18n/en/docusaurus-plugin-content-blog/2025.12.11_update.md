Security and ease of use are at the heart of VakaCloud. Our latest update focuses exactly on these – bringing peace of mind and fluidity to the everyday life of the daycare.

We have made extensive improvements to our backend systems to ensure that children's and staff's data are as safe as possible.

## Security to a New Level

We have significantly strengthened the security of the entire platform. Although the changes happen "under the hood", they guarantee you an even more reliable service:

* **Enhanced Data Encryption:** All data stored in the system is protected with even stronger encryption. Data remains safe in all situations.
* **Secure Connection:** We have updated the way traffic is encrypted. The connection is protected end-to-end, ensuring data integrity.

## Smoother Use and Management

In addition to technical improvements, we have made everyday life easier with new features:

* **More Precise Data Protection in Groups:** We have improved the way data for different groups and units is kept separate. This ensures that the right information is visible only to the right people, improving privacy protection.
* **Important Safety Information:** We have clarified the management of allergies, medication information, and emergency contacts. This critical information is now stored more clearly and securely.

## 🔑 Attention Regarding Login

In connection with the update, we have renewed our authentication system to improve security.
* This may require a **one-time re-login** for users.
* The change makes logging in even safer in the future.

The updates are available to you immediately.
