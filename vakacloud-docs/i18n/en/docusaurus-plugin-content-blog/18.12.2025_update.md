VakaCloud is constantly evolving, and we want to keep you in the loop with every improvement. With this update, we are introducing a brand-new way to track service development directly within the application.

In addition, we have made significant enhancements to backend reliability and data protection.

## Never Miss an Update

We want you to always know what's new in VakaCloud. We have added a dedicated **"What's New" section** to the application.

* **Instant Notifications:** See a summary of new features and fixes as soon as they are released.
* **Easy to Track:** A new notification badge lets you know when there is something new to read. You'll never miss an improvement that makes your daily work easier.

## Enhanced Data Protection

Security is our top priority. We have strengthened our backend operations to ensure that all data remains secure in every situation.

* **Optimized Backups:** We have updated our backup processes to be even more comprehensive. This guarantees data preservation and recoverability with greater reliability.
* **Backend Updates:** We have made technical changes under the hood that improve service stability and performance.

## Smoother User Experience

Based on your feedback, we have refined the user interface and login process:

* **Cookie Management:** We have clarified the cookie consent banner to be more user-friendly while meeting strict compliance requirements.
* **Minor Tweaks:** We have made several small adjustments to the user interface to make navigation and logging in smoother.
