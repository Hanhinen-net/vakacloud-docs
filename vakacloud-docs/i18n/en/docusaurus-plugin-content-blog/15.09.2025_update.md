### New Features

**1. Mobile-Optimized Interface**
We have refined the user experience so that all the most important functions can be easily performed on a phone:
* **Staff:** Recording children's attendance and marking daily events can be done directly from the group room on a tablet or phone.
* **Guardians:** Booking care times and reading messages has been made as clear as possible.

**2. Real-Time Message Center**
Forget about paper notes traveling in backpacks.
* **Messages:** Secure, WhatsApp-style communication between guardians and staff.
* **Notice Board:** Important bulletins (e.g., trip days or equipment lists) reach everyone at once.

The update is now available to all users.
